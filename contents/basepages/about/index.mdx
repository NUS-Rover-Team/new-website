NUS Rover Team is the flagship engineering initiative by the students of NUS SEDS, a club run by a diverse group of students who are passionate about space exploration, latest discoveries and technologies, and upcoming rules and regulations in the domain of space.

Consisting of 26 highly dedicated and passionate students from the Faculty of Engineering, School of Computing and Faculty of Science, our team’s aim is to design and build a Remotely Operated Vehicle (ROV) that can accomplish a variety of tasks with some degree of autonomous capabilities. The numerous applications for rover technology include space exploration, warehouse management, disaster search and rescue and explosive ordnance disposal. Experience garnered as part of the team makes our members highly employable in today’s engineering, manufacturing, robotics and space scene.

The NUS Rover Team is participating in the University Rover Challenge (URC) organized by The Mars Society from November 2020 (registration) to June 2021 (competition). The Team is preparing for its System Acceptance Review submission due on 5th March 2021.  The URC finals held every year at the Mars Desert research Station in Utah, USA poses 4 missions, namely, a science mission, a delivery mission, an equipment servicing mission and an autonomous traversal mission, to teams and their rovers.
